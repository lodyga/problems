Given a list of integers and a single sum value, return the first two values (parse from the left please) in order of appearance that add up to form the sum.

<pre>
sum_pairs([11, 3, 7, 5],         10)
               ^--^      3 + 7 = 10
== [3, 7]

sum_pairs([4, 3, 2, 3, 4],         6)
           ^-----^         4 + 2 = 6, indices: 0, 2 *
              ^-----^      3 + 3 = 6, indices: 1, 3
                 ^-----^   2 + 4 = 6, indices: 2, 4
   entire pair is earlier, and therefore is the correct answer
== [4, 2]

sum_pairs([0, 0, -2, 3], 2)
there are no pairs of values that can be added to produce 2.
== None/nil/undefined (Based on the language)

sum_pairs([10, 5, 2, 3, 7, 5],         10)
               ^-----------^   5 + 5 = 10, indices: 1, 5
                     ^--^      3 + 7 = 10, indices: 3, 4
entire pair is earlier, and therefore is the correct answer
== [3, 7]
Negative numbers and duplicate numbers can and will appear.
