# Validate Stack Sequences
https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/description/

Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]\
Output: true\
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:\
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),\
pop() -> 4,\
push(5),\
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]\
Output: false\
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
