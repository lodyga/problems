https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/


Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8\
Output:k
[\
[1,1,6],\
[1,2,5],\
[1,7],\
[2,6]\
]

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5\
Output:\
[\
[1,2,2],\
[5]\
]
