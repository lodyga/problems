# Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/description/

Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]\
Output: 2\
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]\
Output: 5\
Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
