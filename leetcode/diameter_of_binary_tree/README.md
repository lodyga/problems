# Diameter of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/


Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
<pre>
    __1
   /   \
  2     3
 / \
4   5
</pre>

Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: root = [1,2]
<pre>
  1
 /
4
</pre>
Output: 1
