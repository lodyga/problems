# Is Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/


Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"\
Output: true

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"\
Output: false
