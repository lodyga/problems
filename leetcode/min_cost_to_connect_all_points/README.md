# Min Cost to Connect All Points
https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/

You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].

The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]\
Output: 20\
Explanation:\
We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.\
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]\
Output: 18
