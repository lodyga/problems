https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/description/

Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2\
Output: 4\
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:\
[(1,0,1),0,1]\
[(1,0,1,0),1]\
[1,(0,1,0,1)]\
[1,0,(1,0,1)]

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0\
