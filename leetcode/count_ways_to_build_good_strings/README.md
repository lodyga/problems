# Count Ways To Build Good Strings
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-good-strings/description/

<p>
Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 10**9 + 7.

<b>Example 1:</b>
Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation:
One possible valid good string is "011".
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011".
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.

<b>Example 2:</b>
Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".
