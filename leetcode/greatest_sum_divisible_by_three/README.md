https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-sum-divisible-by-three/


Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]\
Output: 18\
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [4]\
Output: 0\
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]\
Output: 12\
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
