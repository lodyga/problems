# Single Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [2,2,1]\
Output: 1

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]\
Output: 4

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: nums = [1]\
Output: 1
