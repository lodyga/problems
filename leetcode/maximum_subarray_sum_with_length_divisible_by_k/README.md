# Maximum Subarray Sum With Length Divisible by K
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray-sum-with-length-divisible-by-k/


You are given an array of integers nums and an integer k.

Return the maximum sum of a

of nums, such that the size of the subarray is divisible by k.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [1,2], k = 1\
Output: 3\
Explanation:\
The subarray [1, 2] with sum 3 has length equal to 2 which is divisible by 1.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5], k = 4\
Output: -10\
Explanation:\
The maximum sum subarray is [-1, -2, -3, -4] which has length equal to 4 which is divisible by 4.

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: nums = [-5,1,2,-3,4], k = 2\
Output: 4\
Explanation:\
The maximum sum subarray is [1, 2, -3, 4] which has length equal to 4 which is divisible by 2.
