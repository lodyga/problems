https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/


Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: k = 1\
Output: 1\
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: k = 2\
Output: -1\
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: k = 3\
Output: 3\
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
