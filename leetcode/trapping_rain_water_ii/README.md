# Trapping Rain Water II
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/

Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]\
Output: 4\
Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.\
We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.\
The total volume of water trapped is 4.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]\
Output: 10
