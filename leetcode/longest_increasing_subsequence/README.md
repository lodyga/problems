https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing 
subsequence


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]\
Output: 4\
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]\
Output: 4

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\
Output: 1
