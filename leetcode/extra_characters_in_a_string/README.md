# Extra Characters in a String
https://leetcode.com/problems/extra-characters-in-a-string/description/

<p>
You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.

Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.

<b>Example 1:</b>
Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.

<b>Example 2:</b>
Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and "world" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return 3.
