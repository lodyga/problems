# Repeated DNA Sequences
https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

    For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.

When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"\
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"\
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
