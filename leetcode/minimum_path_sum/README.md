# Minimum Path Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]\
Output: 7\
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]\
Output: 12
