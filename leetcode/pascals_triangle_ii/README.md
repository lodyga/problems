https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/description/


Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: rowIndex = 3\
Output: [1,3,3,1]

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: rowIndex = 0\
Output: [1]

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: rowIndex = 1\
Output: [1,1]
