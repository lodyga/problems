https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: s = "abc"\

Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: s = "aaa"\
Output: 6\
