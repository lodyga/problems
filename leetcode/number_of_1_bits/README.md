Input: n = 11\
Output: 3\
Explanation:\
The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: n = 128\
Output: 1\
Explanation:\
The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: n = 2147483645\
Output: 30\
Explanation:\
The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.
