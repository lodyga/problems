# Maximum Score From Removing Substrings
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/

You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5\
Output: 19\
Explanation:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.

Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4\
Output: 20
