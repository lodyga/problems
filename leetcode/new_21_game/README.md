# New 21 Game
https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10\
Output: 1.00000\
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10\
Output: 0.60000\
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.\
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10\
Output: 0.73278
