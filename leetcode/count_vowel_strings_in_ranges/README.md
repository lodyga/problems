# Count Vowel Strings in Ranges
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-vowel-strings-in-ranges/

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a 2D array of integers queries.

Each query queries[i] = [li, ri] asks us to find the number of strings present at the indices ranging from li to ri (both inclusive) of words that start and end with a vowel.

Return an array ans of size queries.length, where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Note that the vowel letters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.


<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: words = ["aba","bcb","ece","aa","e"], queries = [[0,2],[1,4],[1,1]]\
Output: [2,3,0]\
Explanation: The strings starting and ending with a vowel are "aba", "ece", "aa" and "e".\
The answer to the query [0,2] is 2 (strings "aba" and "ece").\
to query [1,4] is 3 (strings "ece", "aa", "e").\
to query [1,1] is 0.\
We return [2,3,0].

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: words = ["a","e","i"], queries = [[0,2],[0,1],[2,2]]\
Output: [3,2,1]\
Explanation: Every string satisfies the conditions, so we return [3,2,1].
