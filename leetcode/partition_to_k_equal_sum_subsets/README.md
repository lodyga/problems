https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if it is possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [4,3,2,3,5,2,1], k = 4\
Output: true\
Explanation: It is possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3\
Output: false
