# Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence
https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/

<p>
You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

<b>Example 1:</b>
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.

<pre>
<b>Example 2:</b>
Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Example 3:</b>
Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
