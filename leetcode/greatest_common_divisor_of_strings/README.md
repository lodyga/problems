# Greatest Common Divisor of Strings
https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"\
Output: "ABC"

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"\
Output: "AB"

<b>Example 3:</b>\
Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"\
Output: ""
