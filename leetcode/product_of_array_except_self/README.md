https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

<b>Example 1:</b>\
Input: nums = [2, 3, 4, 5]\
Output: [60, 40, 30, 24]

<b>Example 2:</b>\
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]\
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
